### Even More
Shake off that COVID-era malaise by doing something stupid!

Join us (virtually) to get in shape. 

On every even numbered day in June 2021, you'll be running a little bit more than you did on the previous one.
It all starts on Wednesday June 2, 2021.

So for example, you may choose to run half a mile on June 2, one mile on June 4, a mile and a half on June 6, and so on. You decide the distance, as long as it continues to increase until the final day on Wednesday June 30.
